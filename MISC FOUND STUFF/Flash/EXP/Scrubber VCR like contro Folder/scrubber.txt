Scrubber v1.0
The scrubber is a sweet little controller for reviewing your
shockwave movies. It provides VCR type controls to navigate through
any movie clip you tell it to. It's super easy to put into any movie
your working on... just copy and paste, then set one variable to
point to the movie you want to control! It has the following
controls: play, stop, fast foward, reverse, beginning, end. It shows
the current frame of the target movie, and has a "live" speed
adjuster.
