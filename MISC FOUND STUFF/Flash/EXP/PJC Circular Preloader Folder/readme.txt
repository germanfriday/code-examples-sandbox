PJC's Circular Loader.

This loader creates a simple animation when your movie is loaded - like a clock it moves 
from 0% through 100%, then it automatically fades out. Simple, stylish, 100% functional.

1) make a new layer on the first scene to put your loader in, and copy and paste the symbol 
"loadermain" from the *.fla file, into the empty frame 1.
2) Make sure there are no blank keyframes after the keyframe containing the loader, and 
that it extends on the main timeline for the length of your movie
3) Put a stop action on frame 1.
4) Make the rest of the your movie start on frame 4.
5) Upload to the internet, and test the new loader!
