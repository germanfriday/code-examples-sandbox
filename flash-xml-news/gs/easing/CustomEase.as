VERSION: 0.91
DATE: 8/17/2008
ACTIONSCRIPT VERSION: 2 (AS3 version is also available)
UPDATES AT: http://blog.greensock.com 
DESCRIPTION:
	Facilitates creating custom bezier eases with the GreenSock Custom Ease Builder tool. It's essentially
	a place to store the bezier segment information for each ease instead of recreating it inside each
	function call which would slow things down. Please use the interactive tool available at 
	http://blog.greensock.com/customease/ to generate the necessary code.
