Objective: Create an identity to introduce and promote a newly constructed bocce court and restaurant, and develop marketing materials which include a stationery system, player’s handbook, print ads, event planning brochure and direct mail, informative folder with step cut insert sheets, outdoor signage, restaurant graphics, and web site.Challenge: Project an image and environment that appealed to a broad targeted audience, generating interest from newcomers to the sport as well as the more seasoned bocce players.Results: SF Design met the challenge by using traditional colors, classic type fonts, custom illustrations and diagrams, and creating a logo that has enough “edge” to make an appealing package for all. The print materials were produced during the construction phase of the facility, coordinating the design and print production to coincide with the Grand Opening Detroit Lions charity event. A web site was also produced which offered up to the minute images showing the progress of the construction. Upon completion, a comprehensive web site was launched announcing the grand opening and features extensive information on bocce leagues, court costs, bocce rules and regulations, event planning, and dining.SF Design worked closely with a public relations firm, retained by Palazzo di Bocce, to help meet a tight schedule, stay on budget, and exceed expectations by all, resulting in a successful grand opening and a thriving new business.
