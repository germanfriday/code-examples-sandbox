PHP Turbine 7 for Linux Installation
==============================================================================
This is the manual installation of PHP Turbine 7, to install in
a more "automatic" way, please run install.sh or open docs/install.htm.

To install manually please follow these steps:

1) Locate your php.ini file and the PHP extensions directory (normally inside 
your PHP installation directory). This information is needed because we'll add 
a php_turbine entry to php.ini and then copy the turbine runtime into inside 
the PHP extensions directory. It's also necessary that you learn which PHP 
engine version is running on your machine.


2) Copy the turbine runtime (inside the turbine7/ directory) into the 
extensions directory - assuming php_root/ is the path to your PHP 
installation, in PHP 4 you'll simply need to do:
cp -r turbine7/ php_root/extensions/

While in PHP 5, you should copy to inside the PHP installation directory itself:
cp -r turbine7/ php_root/


3) Next we'll add the PHP Turbine 7 extension entry to the php.ini file. 
Depending on your PHP engine version, you'll need to add a specific 
PHP Turbine module from this list:
===========================================
PHP Engine Version   -> PHP Turbine Module:
===========================================
5.0.0 to 5.0.2       -> php_turbine7_5.0.0.so
5.0.0zts to 5.0.2zts -> php_turbine7_5.0.0zts.so
4.3.0 to 4.3.9       -> php_turbine7_4.3.0.so
4.3.0zts to 4.3.9zts -> php_turbine7_4.3.0zts.so
4.2.3                -> php_turbine7_4.2.1.so
4.2.3zts             -> php_turbine7_4.2.3zts.so
4.2.1                -> php_turbine7_4.2.1.so
4.2.2                -> php_turbine7_4.2.1.so
4.1.0 to 4.2.0       -> php_turbine7_4.1.0.so
4.0.6 and 4.0.5      -> php_turbine7_4.0.5.so
4.0.4                -> php_turbine7_4.0.4.so

Choose a PHP engine version entry with the "zts" suffix if your PHP engine is 
compiled with thread safety enabled. For example PHP compiled as an Apache 2.0
module usually has thread safety enabled, but PHP for Apache 1.3.* does not.
The PHP engine running as a CGI-Bin does not have thread safety enabled.

If your PHP engine version is not in this list, try using the last available 
PHP Turbine module, the topmost entry in the above list. If the module doesn't 
work, please contact support@blue-pacific.com .

After choosing the right PHP Turbine module, add the following lines to php.ini:
; PHP Turbine 7 settings
extension=turbine7/*module*
; PHP Turbine 7 end of settings

Where *module* should be substituted by the appropriate module from the 
above list. For example if we were adding Turbine to PHP 5.0.0, the following 
lines would be used (the table says PHP Version 5.0.0 -> php_turbine7_5.0.0.so):
; PHP Turbine 7 settings
extension=turbine7/php_turbine7_5.0.0.so
; PHP Turbine 7 end of settings

Please make sure your extension_dir entry is set to the absolute path of the 
PHP extensions directory - in PHP 4 it should be pointing to (php_root is 
the PHP installation dir):
extension_dir = php_root/extensions

However in PHP 5 the extension_dir should be pointing to the PHP installation 
directory itself:
extension_dir = php_root


4) Since the web server user is usually 'nobody', we need to give permissions
for Turbine logging, caching and charting - in PHP 4 please do the following:
chmod o+rx  php_root/extensions/turbine7/*
chmod o+rw  php_root/extensions/turbine7/turbine.log
chmod o+rwx  php_root/extensions/turbine7/cache
chmod -R o+rx  php_root/extensions/turbine7/chart
chmod -R o+rx  php_root/extensions/turbine7/font

While in PHP 5 do the following instead:
chmod o+rx  php_root/turbine7/*
chmod o+rw  php_root/turbine7/turbine.log
chmod o+rwx  php_root/turbine7/cache
chmod -R o+rx  php_root/turbine7/chart
chmod -R o+rx  php_root/turbine7/font


5) You now need to restart the web server. On Apache for example:
apachectl restart


6) To install the samples you need to make web-available the directory to
where you've previously untared the installation file.
So, suppose the directory was /that_path/phpturbine you could add the following 
to the access.conf Apache configuration file:

Alias /phpturbine /that_path/phpturbine
<Directory /that_path/phpturbine>
Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
</Directory>


7) To test if everything is fine, open up a web browser with the Flash plugin
installed and request:
 http://web_server_address/phpturbine/samples/helloworlds/default.htm

Now type in some text and click submit - if a Flash movie containing your text
appears everything should be working fine.
You can check more info on Turbine plug-in by looking at the output
of the phpinfo() command.

Enjoy!
